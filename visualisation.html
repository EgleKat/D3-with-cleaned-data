          <h4>About the Visualisation</h4>
          

          This visualisation displays the world map and displays all power plants given by dataset (provided they have a latitude and longitude). The power plants are displayed in three different colours: renewable, non-renewable and other. These can be further broken down:
          <ul>
               <li>
                    <h5>Renewable:</h5>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Geothermal</li>
                         <li>Hydro</li>
                         <li>Solar</li>
                         <li>Wave and Tidal</li>
                         <li>Wind</li>
                         <li>Biomass</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>

                <li>
                    <h5>Non-renewable:</h5>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Coal</li>
                         <li>Gas</li>
                         <li>Oil</li>
                         <li>Nuclear</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>

               <li>
                    <h5>Other:</h5>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Waste</li>
                         <li>Other</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>

          </ul>
          I decided to classify waste as 'Other', because I found that even though the world is constantly producing waste - not all of it can be used for energy and that in most cases they only burn plastics, which are made of non-renewable materials. (<a href = "https://zerowasteeurope.eu/2015/08/is-waste-a-source-of-renewable-energy/">source</a>, <a href = "https://www.plasticsmakeitpossible.com/about-plastics/types-of-plastics/what-are-plastics/">source</a>, <a href = "https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/ugc/articles/2009/09/is-wastetoenergy-renewable.html">source</a>)

          <h4>Colours</h4>

          I wanted to invoke an emotional response from the colours, hence I chose green and red to represent the power plants (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4711/624c0f72d8c85ea6813b8ec5e8abeedfb616.pdf">source</a>). 
          I decided to choose against primary colours for representing the power plants, because it would draw too much emotion from the audience and knowing that even the renewable power plants have their downfalls (<a href="https://corporate.vattenfall.com/about-energy/pros-and-cons-of-energy-sources/">source</a>, I picked tertiary colours.

          I used a colour picker based on the web (<a href="https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/">colour picker tool</a>) to determine complementary colours that would still invoke a more tame emotional response. 
          <br>
          <span class="colorSpan" style="background-color: #008000; ">From bright green </span>  to <span class="colorSpan" style="background-color: #4e9621">less bright green </span> and
          <span class="colorSpan" style="background-color: #FF0000">from bright red </span>  to <span class="colorSpan" style="background-color: #96214e; color: white">plum-like red.</span>

          <h4>Interaction</h4>

          The visualisation can be interacted with in a few ways.

          <ul>
               <li><h5>Tooltip</h5>
                Hovering over any of the power plants will provide relevant information (if present): country and year it was built in, the name of the power plant and the main fuel type. I chose to only display one fuel type because that would be the most relevant thing to the audience and introducing more fuel types would make the graph confusing.</li>
               <li><h5>Legend</h5>
                The legend provides information about the colour representation on the map. By clicking on one of the legend items, relevant data points are toggled to be hidden or to be shown on the map. This functionality provides a better way of investigating the map further, as some of the data points can be clustered on top of each other.     
                </li>
               <li><h5>Zoom and Pan</h5>
               If the user wants to investigate a country or a region in more depth, they can use the zoom functionality. Using the scroll wheel or double clicking on the map will zoom the map in. It will repaint the power plant data points to fit the appropriate zoom level. Clicking and dragging can also be utilised to navigate around the map. This functionality is already very intuitive to a computer literate user, hence I decided not to provide UI elements that would act as instructions. 
               <br>There are limits on how much zooming and panning you can do. I picked the zoom boundary amounts appropriately so that at the highest zoom option the user can still see the data points clearly. The panning amount is limited by the size of the map. 
               </li>
          </ul>
          There was a possibility to make the circles', representing the power plants, sizes different dependant on the megawatt-hours produced by each power plant, however I specifically chose against it because:
          <ol>
           <li>The information would be irrelevant to the audience as the visualisation is about renewable and not-renewable power plants identifying areas that are more enviornmentally-friendly. </li>
           <li>The map would get overcluttered and difficult to identify specific power plants painted on top of each other.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>The Audience</h4>
          The main audience for the visualisation is people who want to know which countries are leaving a stronger environmental impact with energy production. The map displays the overall distribution of renewable and non-renewable power sources as well as providing the ability to find out more information about a specific power plant. The visualisation utilises important points of the dataset but doesn't clutter the screen with unnecessary information. (<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Taxonomy-of-Clutter-Reduction-for-Information-Ellis-Dix/1901b3a9b66cbd2d3705175a37e17b49516c9647">source</a>,<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Clutter-Reduction-in-Multi-Dimensional-Data-Using-Peng-Ward/85bd1bb8727a64d5a32f5f258eb42aa6476e6980">source</a>)
